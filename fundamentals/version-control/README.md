# Version Control

Version control system aka source control system is a practice of tracking and managing changes to software code.

Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.

eg :- Git , Big Bucket&#x20;

### Distributed version control <a href="#distributed-version-control" id="distributed-version-control"></a>

Earlier instances of VCSes, including CVS, Subversion (SVN), and Perforce, used a centralized server to store a project's history. This centralization meant that the one server was also potentially a single point of failure.

Git is _distributed_, which means that a project's complete history is stored both on the client _and_ on the server. You can edit files without a network connection, check them in locally, and sync with the server when a connection becomes available. If a server goes down, you still have a local copy of the project. Technically, you don't even have to have a server. Changes could be passed around in e-mail or shared by using removable media, but no one uses Git this way in practice.
